# Skyler's Home Bar

This is a collection of drink recipes that I use to make drinks for myself! 

Notes on the recipes:
* These are subject to my personal tastes and prefences so take ratings with a grain of salt
* I use semi-simple syrup for most drinks which is 1.5:1 sugar to water
    * Unless its demerara syrup which is rich at 2:1 sugar to water
* I use a 2oz pour for most drinks
* Sources for drinks may be unknown or from a variety of sources
