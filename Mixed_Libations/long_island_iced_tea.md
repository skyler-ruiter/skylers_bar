#### Notes:
> A lot of ingredients but comes together to make something tall and refreshing with a pretty good kick to it. The tequila comes through stronger than the rest in my experience but it's a good drink to have on a hot day. Can also alter the level of coke to make it stronger or weaker depending on your preference.
