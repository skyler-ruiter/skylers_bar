#### Notes:
> It's an apertif so its great for before dinner and with dinner to keep your appetite up. It's also very refreshing and light making it great for a summer drink as well. The prosecco takes front and center so you should hopefully already enjoy that but I use this is a tool to get accustumed to the Aperol flavors. Since the bitterness of european liqueurs can be a bit much for some people, this is a great way to ease into it.
