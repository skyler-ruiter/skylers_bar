#### Notes:
> It's amazing, way more amazing than I was ready for. It's super refreshing and a great way to enjoy both prosecco and St. Germain and I think lemon twist really brings it together aesthetically. I think mint might also be a great addition to this drink since it looks like it wants something green to the look.
