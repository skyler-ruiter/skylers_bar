#### Notes:
> This has got to be one of my absolute favorite drinks. It's small so it doesn't overstay its welcome, it has this amazing combination of flavors that is so simple yet so delicous, and its super easy to make! Can't recommend this drink enough especially for those who are new to cocktails.
