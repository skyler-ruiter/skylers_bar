#### Notes:
> One of my favorite drinks and a really easy one with few ingredients. The drink looks really pleasant and is a great drink for any season. It has the interesting sloe berry taste that is mellowed out by the citrus and sweet and  the club soda gives it a nice fizz. I would recommend this drink to anyone who likes gin and citrus.
