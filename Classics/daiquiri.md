#### Notes:
> God almighty this drink is just so good. Perfect refreshing drink for a warm day. It's light, the rum (especially a good rum) has that funk, and the sour sweet combo to support the funky rum taste just makes for a drink that I could drink all day long. Super simple and one of my go-to drinks.
