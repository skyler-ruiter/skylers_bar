#### Notes:
> I'm a huge fan of mules especially london mules! It is really easy to make and fun to drink and doesn't have a strong taste of liqour. Fresh lime juice and a good ginger beer really go a long way. It's interesting how having bottom shelf liqour and top shelf ginger beer and lime juice can really show how important the non-liqour ingredients are, especially here. Garnish mint for a refreshing drink and candied ginger for a sweeter drink. Straw's are nice for copper mugs as well.
