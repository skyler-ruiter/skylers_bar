#### Notes:
> Yeah what can I saw except its awesome. It's a daquiri which is already a favorite but now we blend in ice and strawberries to make this drink on a nice summer day a magical experience. Would recommend crushing ice as much as possible before blending however as it can be a bit chunky otherwise.
