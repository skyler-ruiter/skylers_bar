#### Notes:
> I'm not sure about this drink. It's one that I make and i'm just meh on, where it tastes okay enough for me to drink it but not for me to fall in love. But its a good drink for a hot day and sips for a long time without getting boring. I need to look into alternatives to this recipe because I think there is a lot of potential here that's being missed.
