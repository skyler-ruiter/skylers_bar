#### Notes:
> Very confusing drink. It's a pretty tasty drink but it has a weird mouthfeel because of the whole egg and ends up a drink that while fun to drink is not what i'm used to drinking. I do plan on trying more flips in the future to see if this is an aquired taste or if this is just a weird drink.
