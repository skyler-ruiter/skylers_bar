#### Notes:
> It's an interesting tropical rum drink and not the average one. This one has campari making it more bitter but it also has the simple sour base and some pinapple juice to up the tropical taste. Finally the jamacian rum gives it the signature rum funk that makes it a rum drink. It's a good drink to have on a hot day. Didn't fall in love with it but I think its an acquired taste.
