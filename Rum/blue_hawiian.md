#### Notes:
> My mom's favorite drink for the most part and loves when I make it for her. It's super tasty, doesn't really taste like liquor and has lots of good coconut and pinapple vibes with a great blue color. It even gets an umbrella and uses a hurricane glass! Can't recommend this one enough for a nice summer drink.
