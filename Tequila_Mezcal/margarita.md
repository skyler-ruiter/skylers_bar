#### Notes:
> Yeah I'm not a huge fan since I don't like tequila very much but it's a classic and the first few sips are genuinly good. If you're a tequila fan then absolutely this is an awesome cocktail. However it really does need fresh and quality ingredients since this cocktail is very dependent on their quality since there are only 4 ingredients.
